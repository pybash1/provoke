# models/

## Purpose

The `models/` directory contains the binary machine learning models generated by the training process.

## Files

- **`content_classifier.bin`**: The primary model currently used by `ml_classifier.py` and the crawler.
- **`content_classifier_XXX.bin`**: Backup or versioned models named after their precision scores (e.g., `_989` means 98.9% precision).

## Usage

These models are loaded using the `fasttext` library. The path to the active model is usually configured in `quality_config.py`.
